                Hi, I&apos;m <strong>Sahan Vibhashana Bandara</strong>, a
                passionate frontend developer dedicated to crafting
                user-friendly, visually stunning, and performant websites. With
                a strong foundation in <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong>,
                and <strong>TypeScript</strong>, I specialize in creating
                responsive, accessible, and dynamic user interfaces using modern
                frameworks like <strong>React</strong> and{" "}
                <strong>Next.js</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                My journey in web development began with a fascination for
                design and technology, and over the years, it has evolved into a
                career that allows me to combine creativity with
                problem-solving. I&apos;ve had the privilege of collaborating on
                diverse projects, from simple landing pages to complex web
                applications, honing my skills in frameworks like{" "}
                <strong>TailwindCSS</strong>, <strong>Sass, ShadCN,</strong> and
                libraries such as <strong>Chakra UI</strong> and{" "}
                <strong>Material UI</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond coding, I&apos;m passionate about continuous learning. I
                actively keep up with industry trends, experiment with emerging
                technologies, and love collaborating with cross-functional teams
                to bring innovative ideas to life.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll find me exploring design
                inspiration, contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying a
                good cup of coffee.
              </p>
              <p>
