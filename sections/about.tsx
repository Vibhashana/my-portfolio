                Hi, I&apos;m Sahan Vibhashana Bandara, a passionate frontend
                developer dedicated to crafting user-friendly, visually
                stunning, and performant websites. With a strong foundation in
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, I specialize in creating
                responsive, accessible, and dynamic user interfaces using modern
                frameworks like React and Next.js.
              </p>
              <p>
                My journey in web development began with a fascination for
                design and technology, and over the years, it has evolved into a
                career that allows me to combine creativity with
                problem-solving. I&apos;ve had the privilege of collaborating on
                diverse projects, from simple landing pages to complex web
                applications, honing my skills in frameworks like TailwindCSS,
                Sass, ShadCN, and libraries such as Chakra UI and Material UI.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also enjoy diving into backend-friendly integrations,
                utilizing tools like Sanity for content management and ensuring
                seamless user experiences with form management libraries like
                React Hook Form and validation tools like Zod. Whether it&apos;s
                building from scratch or refining existing designs, I bring
                attention to detail, a user-centered approach, and a commitment
                to delivering quality results.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond coding, I&apos;m passionate about continuous learning. I
                actively keep up with industry trends, experiment with emerging
                technologies, and love collaborating with cross-functional teams
                to bring innovative ideas to life.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll find me exploring design
                inspiration, contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying a
                good cup of coffee.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let&apos;s create something incredible together. Feel free to
                check out my projects or reach outâ€”I&apos;d love to connect!
